# FoggyKitchen Terraform OCI Course

## LESSON 4 - Load Balancer + NAT Gateway + Bastion Host

In this lesson we will create brand new regional subnets inside current VCN: **(1)** dedicated Load Balancer public subnet and **(2)** special dedicated subnet for Bastion Host which will enable access to private/non-public resources. The first subnet which has been created in the previous lessons will be still used to nest webserver VMs there. But this time VMs will not receive public IPs during deployment phase (*assign_public_ip = false*). Since that moment we can treat them as nested in private subnet (they are not public). In that case previously used Internet Gateway will not be sufficient and we need to create NATGateway entity and route traffic there (*RouteTableViaNAT*). As VMs are not visible directly from the Internet with public IPs, to access them with SSH protocol, we need to jump via bastion host. This reconfiguration should have a reflection on the usage of *Null Provider*. In practice, remote exec will use the connection with webserver VMs via bastion host. Last but not least we also need to change Security Lists. Now Load Balancer and Web server Subnets will be bound with HTTP/HTTPS Security List. Webserver and Bastion host subnets will be bound with SSH Security List.

## Deploy Using Oracle Resource Manager

1. Click [![Deploy to Oracle Cloud](https://oci-resourcemanager-plugin.plugins.oci.oraclecloud.com/latest/deploy-to-oracle-cloud.svg)](https://cloud.oracle.com/resourcemanager/stacks/create?region=home&zipUrl=https://github.com/mlinxfeld/foggykitchen_tf_oci_course/releases/latest/download/LESSON4_load_balancer_NAT_bastion.zip)

    If you aren't already signed in, when prompted, enter the tenancy and user credentials.

2. Review and accept the terms and conditions.

3. Select the region where you want to deploy the stack.

4. Follow the on-screen prompts and instructions to create the stack.

5. After creating the stack, click **Terraform Actions**, and select **Plan**.

6. Wait for the job to be completed, and review the plan.

    To make any changes, return to the Stack Details page, click **Edit Stack**, and make the required changes. Then, run the **Plan** action again.

7. If no further changes are necessary, return to the Stack Details page, click **Terraform Actions**, and select **Apply**. 

## Deploy Using the Terraform CLI

### Clone of the repo
Now, you'll want a local copy of this repo. You can make that with the commands:

Clone the repo from github by executing the command as follows and then go to proper subdirectory:

```
Martin-MacBook-Pro:~ martinlinxfeld$ git clone https://github.com/mlinxfeld/foggykitchen_tf_oci_course.git

Martin-MacBook-Pro:~ martinlinxfeld$ cd foggykitchen_tf_oci_course/

Martin-MacBook-Pro:foggykitchen_tf_oci_course martinlinxfeld$ cd LESSON4_load_balancer_NAT_bastion

```

### Prerequisites
Create environment file with TF_VARs:

```
Martin-MacBook-Pro:LESSON4_load_balancer_NAT_bastion martinlinxfeld$ vi setup_oci_tf_vars.sh

export TF_VAR_user_ocid="ocid1.user.oc1..aaaaaaaaob4qbf2(...)uunizjie4his4vgh3jx5jxa"
export TF_VAR_tenancy_ocid="ocid1.tenancy.oc1..aaaaaaaas(...)krj2s3gdbz7d2heqzzxn7pe64ksbia"
export TF_VAR_compartment_ocid="ocid1.tenancy.oc1..aaaaaaaasbktyckn(...)ldkrj2s3gdbz7d2heqzzxn7pe64ksbia"
export TF_VAR_fingerprint="00:f9:d1:41:bb:57(...)82:47:e6:00"
export TF_VAR_private_key_path="/tmp/oci_api_key.pem"
export TF_VAR_region="eu-amsterdam-1"

Martin-MacBook-Pro:LESSON4_load_balancer_NAT_bastion martinlinxfeld$ source setup_oci_tf_vars.sh
```

### Create the Resources
Run the following commands:

```
Martin-MacBook-Pro:LESSON4_load_balancer_NAT_bastion martinlinxfeld$ terraform init
    
Martin-MacBook-Pro:LESSON4_load_balancer_NAT_bastion martinlinxfeld$ terraform plan

Martin-MacBook-Pro:LESSON4_load_balancer_NAT_bastion martinlinxfeld$ terraform apply
```

### Destroy the Deployment
When you no longer need the deployment, you can run this command to destroy the resources:

```
Martin-MacBook-Pro:LESSON4_load_balancer_NAT_bastion martinlinxfeld$ terraform destroy
```
